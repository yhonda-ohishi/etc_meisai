## Root Causes of Low Coverage

### 1. Service Layer (24.4%)
- Many service methods lack unit tests
- Mock setup complexity with gRPC clients
- Transaction handling tests missing
- Business logic not fully covered

### 2. gRPC Layer (29.7%)
- Server implementation tests incomplete
- Client mock tests missing
- Stream handling untested
- Error scenarios not covered

### 3. Config Package (32.1%)
- Despite adding comprehensive tests, coverage remains low
- Many configuration scenarios untested
- Environment variable handling gaps
- Default value logic not fully covered

### 4. Adapters (38.9%)
- Conversion logic partially tested
- Edge cases in field mapping untested
- Error handling paths missing
- Complex transformation scenarios not covered

## Recommendations for Reaching 95% Target

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Focus on Services (Priority 1)**
   - Add unit tests for all service methods
   - Mock gRPC client interactions
   - Test transaction scenarios
   - Cover error paths

2. **Fix gRPC Coverage (Priority 2)**
   - Complete server implementation tests
   - Add streaming tests
   - Mock client behavior
   - Test all RPC methods

3. **Complete Config Tests (Priority 3)**
   - Test all configuration loading scenarios
   - Cover validation logic
   - Test edge cases and defaults
   - Add integration tests

4. **Enhance Adapter Tests (Priority 4)**
   - Test all conversion methods
   - Add edge case scenarios
   - Cover error handling
   - Test complex transformations

### Estimated Effort

Based on the current gap of 46.7%:
- **Total statements to cover**: ~2,770 additional statements
- **Estimated test cases needed**: ~500-700 new test cases
- **Estimated time**: 3-5 days of focused development

## Technical Challenges

1. **Mock Complexity**: gRPC and database mocks are complex to set up
2. **Test Isolation**: Services depend on external systems
3. **Legacy Code**: Some handlers have tightly coupled logic
4. **Missing Interfaces**: Some components lack testable interfaces

## Conclusion

While significant progress was made in fixing compilation issues and adding some tests, the coverage target of 95% remains distant at 48.3%. The primary challenge is the service and gRPC layers which have minimal test coverage. A focused effort on these critical packages is required to meet the coverage goal.

## Next Steps

1. Create comprehensive service layer tests
2. Implement full gRPC server/client test suite
3. Complete config package test coverage
4. Add adapter transformation tests
5. Run coverage analysis after each phase
6. Update this report with progress
