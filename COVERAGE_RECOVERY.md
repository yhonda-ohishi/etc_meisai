# Coverage Recovery Documentation

## Date: 2025-09-25

## Executive Summary
Successfully fixed critical BaseService deadlock issues and established test infrastructure. However, overall test coverage remains at **0.7%**, far below the 95% target.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. BaseService Deadlock (FIXED ✅)
- **Problem**: `Shutdown()` method held state mutex while calling `LogOperation()`
- **Solution**: Released mutex before logging operation
- **Files Modified**: `src/services/base_service.go`

### 2. Missing Mutex Separation (ALREADY FIXED ✅)
- **Status**: Code already had separate mutexes for state (`mu`) and logging (`logMu`)
- **No action needed**

### 3. Context Timeout Support (ENHANCED ✅)
- **Added**: `WithRetryContext()` method for context-aware retries
- **Files Modified**: `src/services/base_service.go`

### 4. Test Resource Monitoring (IMPLEMENTED ✅)
- **Created**: Test resource monitoring for goroutine/memory/file leak detection
- **Files Created**:
  - `src/services/test_resource_monitor.go`
  - `src/services/base_service_test.go`

## Current Test Coverage Status

### Overall Coverage: 0.7%
- **Target**: 95%
- **Gap**: 94.3%

### Package Breakdown:
- `src/services`: 0.7% (only package with any coverage)
- `src/adapters`: 0.0%
- `src/config`: 0.0%
- `src/grpc`: 0.0%
- `src/handlers`: 0.0%
- `src/middleware`: 0.0%
- `src/models`: 0.0%
- `src/parser`: 0.0%
- `src/repositories`: 0.0%

## Test Structure Discovery
Tests are located in `tests/unit/` directory, not co-located with source:
- `tests/unit/services/` - Contains service tests
- `tests/unit/models/` - Contains model tests
- `tests/unit/handlers/` - Contains handler tests
- etc.

### Test Execution Issues
Many test files have compilation errors due to:
1. Model field mismatches
2. Missing mock implementations
3. Interface changes

## Critical Path Forward

### Phase 1: Fix Compilation Errors (Priority 1)
1. Fix model field names in test files
2. Generate missing mocks
3. Update interfaces

### Phase 2: Increase Coverage (Priority 2)
1. Focus on high-value packages first:
   - `src/grpc` (core functionality)
   - `src/services` (business logic)
   - `src/handlers` (API endpoints)

### Phase 3: Add Missing Tests
1. Create table-driven tests for all packages
2. Focus on error paths and edge cases
3. Add integration tests

## Commands for Coverage Analysis

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
cd C:/go/etc_meisai
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out -coverpkg=./src/... ./tests/unit/...

# Generate HTML coverage report
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html

# View coverage summary
go tool cover -func=coverage.out | tail -1

# Run specific package tests
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out -coverpkg=./src/services ./tests/unit/services
```

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action Required**: Fix compilation errors in test files
2. **Test Organization**: Consider co-locating tests with source code for better maintainability
3. **Mock Generation**: Use mockgen or similar tools to auto-generate mocks
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Add coverage gates to prevent regression
5. **Incremental Approach**: Focus on one package at a time to reach 95% coverage

## Files Modified
- `src/services/base_service.go` - Fixed deadlock, added context support
- `src/services/test_resource_monitor.go` - Created resource monitoring
- `src/services/base_service_test.go` - Created comprehensive tests

## Conclusion
While critical deadlock issues have been resolved, significant work remains to achieve 95% test coverage. The main blocker is compilation errors in existing test files that need to be fixed before coverage can be improved.
