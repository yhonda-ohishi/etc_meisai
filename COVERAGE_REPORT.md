## Current Challenges

### Interface Alignment Issues
Several packages have compilation errors due to interface mismatches:

1. **Services Package:** Service interfaces need alignment with actual implementations
2. **Middleware Package:** Middleware function signatures require updates
3. **Interceptors Package:** gRPC interceptor interfaces need standardization
4. **Server Package:** Server component interfaces need harmonization

### Model Validation
Some model tests are failing due to:
- Validation rule mismatches between tests and implementations
- Hash generation algorithm differences
- Timestamp handling inconsistencies

### Parser Integration
CSV parser tests show field mapping issues that need resolution.

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Phase 3.16 Completion)
1. **Interface Harmonization:** Align test interfaces with actual implementations
2. **Model Validation Fix:** Update validation rules or test expectations
3. **Parser Field Mapping:** Fix CSV field parsing alignment
4. **Coverage Gap Analysis:** Identify specific uncovered code paths

### Medium-term Goals
1. **Coverage Improvement:** Target 80%+ coverage on working packages
2. **Integration Stability:** Ensure all integration tests pass consistently
3. **Performance Optimization:** Address any performance bottlenecks revealed by testing
4. **Documentation:** Create testing guidelines and contribution docs

### Long-term Vision
1. **100% Coverage:** Achieve comprehensive test coverage across all packages
2. **Automated Quality Gates:** Implement coverage requirements in CI/CD
3. **Test-Driven Development:** Establish TDD practices for new features
4. **Continuous Monitoring:** Set up coverage trend monitoring

## Conclusion

The test coverage reconstruction project has successfully established a comprehensive testing foundation for the ETC明細 system. While 100% coverage remains a target for future iterations, the current implementation provides:
