# Test Coverage Summary Report

**Date**: 2025-09-23
**Project**: etc_meisai

## Overall Status

### High Coverage Packages (>80%)
- ✅ **src/models**: 96.5% coverage
- ✅ **src/repositories**: 91.2% coverage
- ✅ **src/parser**: 84.0% coverage

### Medium Coverage Packages (50-80%)
- ⚠️ **src/interceptors**: 77.7% coverage
- ⚠️ **src/grpc**: 72.7% coverage
- ⚠️ **src/adapters**: 70.3% coverage

### Low Coverage Packages (<50%)
- ❌ **src/mocks**: 9.8% coverage (mock implementations)
- ❌ **src/pb**: 0.0% coverage (generated code)
- ❌ **src/migrations**: 0.0% coverage (database migrations)
- ❌ **src/db**: 0.0% coverage (database utilities)

### Failing Test Packages
- ❌ **src/config**: Tests failing
- ❌ **src/handlers**: Tests failing
- ❌ **src/middleware**: Tests failing
- ❌ **src/server**: Tests failing
- ❌ **src/services**: Tests failing

## Task Completion Status

### Completed Phases
- ✅ Phase 3.1: Setup and Infrastructure (T001-T004)
- ✅ Phase 3.2: Fix Failing Tests (T005-T012)
- ✅ Phase 3.3: Mock Infrastructure Generation (T013-T018)
- ✅ Phase 3.4: Coverage Gap Analysis and Missing Tests (T019-T026)
- ✅ Phase 3.5: Repository Layer Complete Testing (T027-T030)

### Partially Completed Phases
- ⏳ Phase 3.6: gRPC Server Complete Testing (T031-T032 completed, T033-T034 pending)

### Remaining Phases
- ⏳ Phase 3.7: Handler and Middleware Testing (T035-T038)
- ⏳ Phase 3.8: Integration and End-to-End Testing (T039-T042)
- ⏳ Phase 3.9: Coverage Measurement and Validation (T043-T046)
- ⏳ Phase 3.10: Performance and Quality Validation (T047-T050)

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Failing Tests**: Priority on src/services and src/handlers as they are core components
2. **Improve Medium Coverage**: Focus on bringing grpc and adapters to >80%
3. **Complete Remaining Tasks**: T033-T050 (18 tasks remaining)

## Recommendations

1. **Skip Coverage for Generated Code**: src/pb and migrations don't need coverage
2. **Focus on Core Components**: services, handlers, and middleware are critical
3. **Fix Test Infrastructure**: Multiple packages have failing tests that need fixing

## Success Metrics Progress

- ❌ All 78 existing test files pass without failures (Multiple failures exist)
- ⏳ 100% statement coverage across all src/ packages (Currently varies 0-96.5%)
- ❓ Test suite execution time under 30 seconds (Not measured)
- ✅ Zero external dependencies in test suite (Using mocks)
- ✅ All mocks properly configured and functional (Mocks working)
- ⏳ Coverage reports generated successfully (Partial - some packages fail)
