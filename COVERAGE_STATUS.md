# Test Coverage Status Report
Generated: 2025-09-23

## Current Status
- **Total Coverage**: 86.4% (Target: 100%)
- **Phase**: Coverage Validation (T017-T020)

## Package Coverage Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed Packages
- `src/server`: 97.3% coverage
- `src/middleware`: 79.2% coverage (needs RateLimit tests)

### üîß In Progress
- `src/interceptors`: Tests created, fixing import issues
- `src/adapters`: Tests created, fixing builder issues
- `src/grpc`: Tests created, fixing imports
- `src/handlers`: Tests created, fixing imports

### ‚ùå Not Started
- `src/models`: Tests created but build failing
- `src/parser`: Tests created but build failing
- `src/repositories`: Tests created but build failing
- `src/services`: Tests created but build failing
- `src/config`: Tests created but build failing

## Known Issues

### Import Path Issues
Many test files use incorrect import paths (`etc_meisai/src` instead of `github.com/yhonda-ohishi/etc_meisai/src`)

### Builder Issues
Test helpers in `tests/helpers/builders.go` use incorrect field names for models

### Coverage Gaps Identified
1. **middleware/security.go**:
   - `RateLimit()` - 0% coverage
   - `NewRateLimiter()` - 0% coverage
   - `RateLimitMiddleware()` - 0% coverage
   - `allow()` - 0% coverage
   - `Allow()` - 0% coverage
   - `cleanup()` - 0% coverage
   - `getClientIP()` - 91.7% (missing edge case)
   - `splitHostPort()` - 75% (missing error case)

## Next Steps (T018-T020)

1. Fix all import path issues in test files
2. Fix builder helper issues
3. Add missing tests for RateLimit functionality
4. Resolve build failures in remaining packages
5. Achieve 100% coverage for all packages

## Commands for Validation

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out -coverpkg=./src/... ./tests/unit/...

# Check total coverage
go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total:

# Generate HTML report
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage_report.html

# Check uncovered lines
go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep -v "100.0%"
```
