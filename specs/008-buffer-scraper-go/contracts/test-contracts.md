# Test Contracts for buffer_scraper.go Coverage

## Error Simulation Contracts

### Contract 1: Download Error Handling
```go
// Test: DownloadMeisai returns error
// Coverage: Lines 33-35 of DownloadMeisaiToBuffer
Contract {
    Given: mockDownloader is nil AND MOCK_CSV_PATH is not set
    When: DownloadMeisai is called and returns error
    Then:
        - Error message contains "failed to download CSV"
        - No file operations are performed
        - BufferResult is nil
}
```

### Contract 2: File Read Error Handling
```go
// Test: readFileToBuffer returns error
// Coverage: Lines 40-42 of DownloadMeisaiToBuffer
Contract {
    Given: Valid CSV path from download
    When: readFileToBuffer returns error (permission denied)
    Then:
        - Error message contains "failed to read CSV file"
        - File removal is attempted
        - BufferResult is nil
}
```

### Contract 3: File Removal Error Logging
```go
// Test: os.Remove fails in deferred function
// Coverage: Lines 48-52 of DownloadMeisaiToBuffer
Contract {
    Given: Successful download and read
    When: File removal fails in deferred cleanup
    Then:
        - Warning logged with "failed to remove temp file"
        - Function still returns successful BufferResult
        - Logger.Printf called with warning message
}
```

## Production Path Contracts

### Contract 4: Nil Mock Dependencies
```go
// Test: Production path with nil mocks
// Coverage: Line 32 condition (mockDownloader == nil)
Contract {
    Given: mockDownloader is nil
    When: DownloadMeisaiToBuffer is called
    Then:
        - Calls actual DownloadMeisai method
        - Follows production code path
        - Returns valid BufferResult
}
```

### Contract 5: Environment Variable Override
```go
// Test: MOCK_CSV_PATH environment variable
// Coverage: Lines 29-31 of DownloadMeisaiToBuffer
Contract {
    Given: MOCK_CSV_PATH environment variable is set
    When: DownloadMeisaiToBuffer is called
    Then:
        - Uses path from environment variable
        - Skips DownloadMeisai call
        - Does not delete file after reading
}
```

## Edge Case Contracts

### Contract 6: Empty CSV File
```go
// Test: Parsing empty CSV file
// Coverage: parseCSVBuffer edge cases
Contract {
    Given: CSV file with 0 bytes
    When: parseCSVBuffer is called
    Then:
        - Returns empty slice [][]string{}
        - RecordCount is 0
        - No errors thrown
}
```

### Contract 7: Malformed CSV Data
```go
// Test: CSV with unclosed quotes
// Coverage: parseCSVBuffer error handling
Contract {
    Given: CSV with malformed quotes
    When: parseCSVBuffer is called
    Then:
        - Handles gracefully or returns error
        - Does not panic
        - Partial data may be returned
}
```

### Contract 8: Large File Handling
```go
// Test: CSV file > 10MB
// Coverage: Memory efficiency
Contract {
    Given: Large CSV file
    When: DownloadMeisaiToBuffer is called
    Then:
        - Completes within 2 seconds
        - Memory usage stays reasonable
        - All records parsed correctly
}
```

## Mock Behavior Contracts

### Contract 9: Mock Downloader Behavior
```go
// Test: MockDownloader implementation
Contract {
    Given: MockDownloader with custom function
    When: DownloadMeisai is called
    Then:
        - Custom function is invoked
        - Parameters passed correctly
        - Return values propagated
}
```

### Contract 10: Mock File Operations
```go
// Test: MockFileOperations tracking
Contract {
    Given: MockFileOperations instance
    When: File operations are performed
    Then:
        - All calls are tracked
        - Paths are recorded
        - Custom behaviors executed
}
```

## Integration Contracts

### Contract 11: Full Success Flow
```go
// Test: Complete successful operation
Contract {
    Given: All operations succeed
    When: DownloadMeisaiToBuffer is called
    Then:
        - CSV downloaded
        - File read successfully
        - Records counted correctly
        - File cleaned up
        - Valid BufferResult returned
}
```

### Contract 12: Partial Failure Recovery
```go
// Test: Recovery from partial failures
Contract {
    Given: Download succeeds, cleanup fails
    When: Operation completes
    Then:
        - Result still returned
        - Warning logged
        - No panic or crash
}
```

## Test Implementation Requirements

### Table-Driven Test Structure
```go
func TestBufferScraperCoverage(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name          string
        setupMocks    func() (*MockDownloader, *MockFileOps, *MockLogger)
        envVars       map[string]string
        expectedError string
        validateResult func(*BufferResult)
    }{
        // Test cases implementing each contract
    }

    for _, tc := range tests {
        t.Run(tc.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // Setup
            // Execute
            // Assert
            // Cleanup
        })
    }
}
```

### Parallel Execution
- All independent tests must use `t.Parallel()`
- File system tests must be isolated with unique directories
- No shared state between tests

### Coverage Verification
```bash
# Must achieve 100% for buffer_scraper.go
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out -coverpkg=./src/scraper ./tests/unit/scraper
go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep buffer_scraper.go
```

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All contracts have corresponding test implementations
2. Each test is independent and repeatable
3. Tests execute in < 2 seconds total
4. No test failures on any platform (Windows/Linux)
5. Coverage report shows 100% for all methods
6. No flaky tests (100 consecutive runs pass)
