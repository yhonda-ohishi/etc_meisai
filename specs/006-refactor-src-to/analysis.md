# Specification Analysis: Full gRPC Architecture Migration

**Feature**: 006-refactor-src-to
**Date**: 2025-09-26
**Analysis Type**: Cross-artifact consistency and completeness check
**Status**: RESOLVED - All critical gaps addressed

## Executive Summary

This analysis examined the consistency and completeness across three critical artifacts:
- **spec.md**: Feature specification with 15 functional requirements
- **plan.md**: ~~Implementation plan (largely template with placeholders)~~ **RESOLVED**: Completed with actual technical decisions
- **tasks.md**: ~~74 implementation tasks organized in 6 phases~~ **UPDATED**: 91 tasks addressing all gaps

**Resolution Status**: All HIGH severity findings have been addressed. The feature is now ready for implementation.

## 5. Readiness Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

All critical gaps have been addressed:
- ✅ plan.md completed with technical decisions
- ✅ GORM hooks migration strategy defined (T036-T041)
- ✅ Rollback procedures documented (T071-T076)
- ✅ Performance baseline capture included (T001-T003)
- ✅ Test cleanup tasks added (T004-T005)
- ✅ All 91 tasks properly sequenced and dependencies mapped

## 6. Implementation Path

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 3.0: Pre-Migration Tasks
2. Capture performance baseline (T001-T003)
3. Clean up any test files in src/ (T004-T005)
4. Proceed with Phase 3.1: Setup

### Critical Path
1. **T001-T003**: Performance baseline (blocks T089)
2. **T036-T041**: GORM hooks migration (blocks service implementation)
3. **T071-T076**: Rollback procedures (required before production)
