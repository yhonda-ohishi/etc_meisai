## Summary
Complete migration from mixed GORM/manual interface architecture to pure gRPC-based architecture with Protocol Buffers as the single source of truth. All data models, repository interfaces, and service contracts will be generated from .proto files, eliminating manual interface definitions and GORM models that currently cause maintenance overhead and consistency issues.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Go 1.21+ (from existing codebase)
**Primary Dependencies**: gRPC, Protocol Buffers, grpc-gateway, buf tooling
**Storage**: MySQL via db_service (gRPC proxy to database)
**Testing**: testify/mock, table-driven tests, mockgen for gRPC mocks
**Target Platform**: Linux server (containerized deployment)
**Project Type**: single - Go microservice with gRPC API
**Performance Goals**: Same response time ¬±10% for all API endpoints (from clarifications)
**Constraints**: Build time under 60 seconds including code generation (from clarifications)
**Scale/Scope**: ~15 models, ~15 repositories, ~16 services to migrate

**User-Provided Implementation Details**:
- Already completed Phase 1-3 (Repository Layer) and partial Phase 4 (Service Layer)
- Created gRPC versions of services: ETCMappingServiceGRPC, ETCMeisaiServiceGRPC, ImportServiceGRPC
- Implemented validation logic from GORM model hooks in service layer
- Using gRPC status codes for error handling
- Proto messages replacing GORM models throughout

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Test File Separation (Principle I)
‚úÖ PASS - Tests already organized in `tests/` directory structure:
- `tests/unit/` for unit tests
- `tests/integration/` for integration tests
- `tests/contract/` for contract tests
- No test files in `src/` directory

### Test-First Development (Principle II)
‚úÖ PASS - TDD approach already applied:
- Contract tests created before implementation (T008-T017)
- Tests written first then made to pass

### Coverage Requirements (Principle III)
‚ö†Ô∏è MONITOR - 100% coverage target maintained
- Coverage validation tasks included (T053-T055)
- Must maintain during migration

### Clean Architecture (Principle IV)
‚úÖ PASS - Clear layer separation maintained:
- `src/models/` ‚Üí Being replaced with proto messages
- `src/services/` ‚Üí gRPC service implementations
- `src/repositories/` ‚Üí gRPC client implementations
- `src/grpc/` ‚Üí gRPC server and handlers
- `src/adapters/` ‚Üí Proto-to-database converters

### Observable Systems (Principle V)
‚úÖ PASS - Logging maintained in all services:
- Structured logging in all gRPC services
- Performance metrics planned (T057)

### Dependency Injection (Principle VI)
‚úÖ PASS - Constructor injection used throughout:
- All services use interface-based DI
- Repository interfaces injected into services

### Simplicity First (Principle VII)
‚úÖ PASS - Migration maintains simplicity:
- Direct gRPC replacement without additional complexity
- Using standard gRPC patterns

### Code Quality Validation (Principle VIII)
‚úÖ PASS - go vet validation enforced:
- Pre-command checks implemented
- All code passes go vet

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 - Single project structure (existing structure maintained)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
‚úÖ COMPLETE - research.md already exists with:

1. **Protocol Buffer conventions resolved**:
   - Decision: snake_case in .proto files, CamelCase in generated Go
   - Rationale: Industry standard for Protocol Buffers
   - Alternatives: Considered keeping Go naming, rejected for proto compatibility

2. **buf tooling for proto management**:
   - Decision: Use buf for proto compilation and linting
   - Rationale: Modern tooling with better dependency management
   - Alternatives: protoc directly, rejected for complexity

3. **gRPC-gateway for HTTP compatibility**:
   - Decision: Include grpc-gateway for REST endpoints
   - Rationale: Backward compatibility with existing HTTP clients
   - Alternatives: Pure gRPC, rejected for migration complexity

**Output**: research.md with all clarifications resolved ‚úÖ

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
‚úÖ COMPLETE - All artifacts already generated:

1. **data-model.md created** with:
   - ETCMeisaiRecord entity with all fields
   - ETCMapping relationships
   - ImportSession workflow states
   - Validation rules from GORM models

2. **API contracts generated** in `/contracts/`:
   - repository-services.yaml - gRPC service definitions
   - business-services.yaml - Business logic layer contracts
   - OpenAPI specs for REST compatibility

3. **Contract tests created**:
   - T008-T013: Repository service tests
   - T014-T017: Integration tests
   - All tests initially failing (TDD approach)

4. **quickstart.md created** with:
   - Setup instructions for gRPC environment
   - Migration verification steps
   - Performance validation procedures

5. **CLAUDE.md exists** at repository root:
   - Updated with gRPC architecture
   - Migration status tracking
   - Constitutional requirements documented

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, contract tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md ‚úÖ

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
‚úÖ COMPLETE - tasks.md already exists with 65 detailed tasks:

**Task Generation Strategy** (already executed):
- Generated from Phase 1 design documents
- Each proto service ‚Üí implementation task
- Each entity ‚Üí migration task
- TDD order maintained throughout

**Task Structure** (actual):
- Phase 1: Setup & Protocol Buffer Infrastructure (T001-T007)
- Phase 2: Tests First (T008-T019)
- Phase 3: Repository Layer Migration (T020-T027d)

**Current Progress**:
- ‚úÖ Phase 1-3 complete (27 tasks)
- üöß Phase 4 in progress (3/7 tasks done)
- ‚è≥ Phase 5-7 pending (35 tasks)

**Output**: 65 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md with [P] markers for parallel execution ‚úÖ
