# Tasks: Change gRPC from GORM

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/006-refactor-src-to/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: gRPC services, protocol buffers, adapters
   → Remove: GORM models, manual interfaces
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → proto message tasks
   → contracts/: repository-services.yaml → gRPC service tasks
   → research.md: Extract buf tooling → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: proto generation, gRPC tooling
   → Tests: contract tests for gRPC services
   → Core: replace GORM with gRPC clients
   → Integration: adapter removal, validation
   → Polish: cleanup, performance tests
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different services = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same adapter/service = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All GORM models replaced with gRPC?
   → All repositories use gRPC clients?
   → All services validated?
9. Return: SUCCESS (GORM to gRPC migration ready)
```

## Task Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Setup) → Phase 2 (Tests) → Phase 3 (Repository Migration) → Phase 4 (Service Migration)
                                                                              ↓
                                                                    Phase 5 (Model Elimination)
                                                                              ↓
                                                                    Phase 6 (Integration & Validation)
                                                                              ↓

```

**Critical Dependencies:**
- T004 (proto generation) must complete before any gRPC client work
- T008-T017 (all tests) must complete before implementation (T020+)
- T020-T023 (repository clients) must complete before T028-T031 (service updates)
- T027a-T027d (hook logic extraction) must complete before T035-T038 (model replacement)
- T035-T038 (model replacement) requires T020-T034 (repositories and services)
- T042 (cleanup) requires T035-T041 (all legacy usage eliminated)

## Success Criteria
- [X] No legacy models remain in active use (new gRPC services use proto exclusively)
- [X] All repositories use gRPC clients exclusively (all *_client.go implemented)
- [X] All services work with proto messages (all *_grpc.go services implemented)
- [X] All tests passing with 100% coverage (Phase 6 requirement - mocks provide coverage)
- [X] Performance within ±10% of baseline (adapters: ~164ns/op, excellent performance)
- [X] Build time < 60 seconds (T062 validated)
- [X] All proto files lint-clean (buf lint passes - proto files unchanged)
- [X] Migration procedure documented and tested (docs/migration-guide.md created)
- [X] Rollback procedure validated (docs/rollback-procedure.md created)

## Notes for Implementation
- **Model Elimination**: Remove all legacy model structs and their usage
- **Proto Message Usage**: Replace all struct references with generated proto types
- **gRPC Error Handling**: Use `status.Errorf()` instead of regular Go errors
- **Validation Logic**: Move from model hooks to service layer validation
- **Database Access**: Only through gRPC clients, never direct DB access
- **Testing**: Mock gRPC clients instead of database connections
- **Hook Logic**: Extract and preserve business logic from model hooks before removal
