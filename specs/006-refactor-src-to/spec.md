# Feature Specification: Full gRPC Architecture Migration

**Feature Branch**: `006-refactor-src-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "refactor src to use gprc, donot use K�g��U�_Go���է��  GORM���hWfK՚�"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: What naming convention should all generated code follow? → A: Protocol Buffer conventions throughout (snake_case in proto, CamelCase in Go)
- Q: What performance metrics should the migration maintain? → A: Same response time ±10% for all API endpoints
- Q: What maximum acceptable build time should the system maintain? → A: Under 60 seconds for full rebuild including code generation
- Q: What rollback strategy should the migration use? → A: Git revert - simply revert commits if issues arise

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer maintaining the ETC meisai system, I need all system components to be generated from a single source of truth to eliminate manual interface definitions and model declarations that currently cause naming inconsistencies, type mismatches, and maintenance overhead. The current mixed architecture where some parts use generated code and others use manual definitions creates confusion and increases the risk of bugs.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer needs to modify a data structure, **When** they update the protocol buffer definition, **Then** all related interfaces, models, and service contracts are automatically regenerated consistently across all layers
2. **Given** a developer needs to add a new service method, **When** they define it in the protocol buffer file, **Then** the method signature is automatically available in repository, service, and API layers without manual interface updates
3. **Given** a developer runs the code generation process, **When** the generation completes, **Then** all manually defined interfaces and models are replaced with protocol buffer generated equivalents
4. **Given** a developer needs to create mock implementations for testing, **When** they run the mock generation tool, **Then** mocks are generated directly from the protocol buffer definitions without manual interface dependencies
5. **Given** the system is fully migrated, **When** a developer searches for interface definitions or model declarations, **Then** they find only protocol buffer files as the source of truth, no manual Go interface or GORM model files

### Edge Cases
- What happens when existing database column names don't match protocol buffer field naming conventions?
- How does system handle backward compatibility during the migration period?
- What happens to existing custom validation logic in GORM models?
- How does system maintain existing business logic that depends on GORM hooks?
- What happens to existing mock implementations that were manually created?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST define all data models as protocol buffer messages instead of manual GORM model declarations
- **FR-002**: System MUST define all repository interfaces as gRPC service definitions instead of manual Go interface declarations
- **FR-003**: System MUST define all service layer interfaces as gRPC service definitions instead of manual Go interface declarations
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate all Go code from protocol buffer definitions as the single source of truth
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing database schema during migration
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve all existing business logic and validation rules during the refactoring
- **FR-007**: System MUST automatically generate mock implementations from protocol buffer definitions for testing
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear mapping between protocol buffer field names and database column names
- **FR-009**: System MUST eliminate all manually defined Go interfaces in the repository layer
- **FR-010**: System MUST eliminate all manually defined GORM models in the models package
- **FR-011**: System MUST ensure type safety and consistency across all layers through generated code
- **FR-012**: System MUST support all existing CRUD operations after migration without functional changes
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain or improve existing test coverage during the refactoring process
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide clear migration path for custom business logic currently in GORM hooks
- **FR-015**: System MUST ensure all generated code follows Protocol Buffer naming conventions (snake_case in .proto files, automatically converted to CamelCase in generated Go code)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Migration MUST maintain same response time ±10% for all API endpoints
- **NFR-002**: Generated code MUST be readable and maintainable for debugging purposes
- **NFR-003**: Build time with code generation MUST remain under 60 seconds for full rebuild
- **NFR-004**: System MUST maintain ability to rollback changes using git revert if critical issues discovered

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Protocol Buffer Definition**: The single source of truth file that defines data structures, service interfaces, and method contracts for the entire system
- **Generated Code**: Automatically produced Go code from protocol buffer definitions including interfaces, structs, and client/server stubs
- **Migration Adapter**: Component that bridges between protocol buffer generated structures and existing database schema during transition
- **Service Contract**: The gRPC service definition that replaces manual Go interface declarations for all service boundaries
