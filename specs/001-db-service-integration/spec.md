# Feature Specification: etc_meisai Server Repository Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-db-service-integration`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "INTEGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md „ÇíË™≠„Çì„ÅßÂÆüË£Ö"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Parsed: Integration of etc_meisai into server_repo with Swagger UI visibility
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: etc_meisai service, server_repo integration, Swagger UI, gRPC service, protocol buffers
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí No clarifications needed - instructions are comprehensive
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow defined for API access and Swagger documentation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements are testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí ETCÊòéÁ¥∞„Éá„Éº„Çø, „Éû„ÉÉ„Éî„É≥„Ç∞, CSV„Ç§„É≥„Éù„Éº„Éà
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No clarifications needed
   ‚Üí No implementation details in requirements
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator, I want the etc_meisai service to be integrated with the server_repo so that all ETC toll data management endpoints are visible and accessible through the unified Swagger UI interface, enabling consistent API documentation and testing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the server_repo is running, **When** I access the Swagger UI, **Then** I can see all etc_meisai endpoints listed alongside other services
2. **Given** an ETC CSV file, **When** I use the import endpoint via Swagger UI, **Then** the data is successfully imported into the system
3. **Given** existing ETC records, **When** I query the list endpoint, **Then** I receive paginated results with proper filtering
4. **Given** ETC data needs mapping, **When** I create a mapping via the API, **Then** the mapping is persisted and can be retrieved
5. **Given** the integrated service, **When** I make requests to etc_meisai endpoints, **Then** they follow the same authentication and error handling patterns as other services

### Edge Cases
- What happens when importing duplicate ETC records?
- How does system handle malformed CSV data during import?
- What occurs when requesting non-existent record IDs?
- How does the system manage concurrent CSV imports?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST expose etc_meisai endpoints through the unified server_repo API gateway
- **FR-002**: System MUST display all etc_meisai operations in the Swagger UI documentation
- **FR-003**: System MUST support creating, reading, updating, and listing ETC toll records
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide CSV import functionality for bulk ETC data loading
- **FR-005**: System MUST enable creation and management of mappings between ETC data and other entities
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing etc_meisai clients
- **FR-007**: System MUST follow the same authentication and authorization patterns as other integrated services
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate API documentation automatically from service definitions
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle errors consistently across all etc_meisai endpoints
- **FR-010**: System MUST support the existing data validation rules for ETC records

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **ETCMeisaiRecord**: Represents individual toll transaction data including date, time, entrance/exit ICs, toll amount, car number, and ETC card information
- **ETCMapping**: Represents relationships between ETC records and other system entities for data correlation
- **ImportSession**: Tracks CSV import operations including status, processed records, and error handling
