# Research: Aligned Test Coverage Reconstruction

**Feature**: 002-aligned-test-coverage
**Date**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Complete

## Research Areas

### 1. Go Testing Best Practices for 100% Coverage

**Decision**: Table-driven tests with comprehensive mocking strategy

**Rationale**:
- Table-driven tests reduce code duplication and improve maintainability
- testify/mock provides powerful mocking capabilities for external dependencies
- testify/assert offers clear, readable assertions
- Coverage-driven development ensures no code paths are missed

**Key Patterns**:
```go
func TestFunction(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        input   InputType
        want    OutputType
        wantErr bool
    }{
        // test cases
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // test implementation
        })
    }
}
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Basic unit tests: Less structured, harder to maintain
- BDD-style testing: Overhead for simple unit tests
- Manual coverage tracking: Error-prone and time-consuming

### 2. Test File Organization for Large Codebases

**Decision**: Separate test directory structure mirroring src/ packages

**Rationale**:
- Clean separation of source code and tests
- Organized test structure following existing project patterns
- Package-level organization maintains clarity
- Centralized test utilities and mocks in tests/ directory

**Structure**:
```
src/
├── models/
│   ├── user.go
│   ├── product.go
│   └── ...
tests/
├── unit/          # Unit tests for src/ packages
│   ├── models/
│   │   ├── user_test.go
│   │   └── product_test.go
│   ├── services/
│   └── ...
├── fixtures/      # Shared test data
├── helpers/       # Test utilities
└── mocks/         # Mock implementations
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Tests alongside source code: Clutters src/ directory structure
- Nested test packages: Adds unnecessary complexity

### 3. Mock Strategy for External Dependencies

**Decision**: Interface-based mocking with testify/mock

**Rationale**:
- Go's interface system enables clean dependency injection
- testify/mock provides assertion capabilities for mock calls
- Centralized mock registry reduces duplication
- Type-safe mocking prevents runtime errors

**Mock Patterns**:
```go
// Interface definition
type UserRepository interface {
    GetUser(id string) (*User, error)
    SaveUser(user *User) error
}

// Mock implementation
type MockUserRepository struct {
    mock.Mock
}

func (m *MockUserRepository) GetUser(id string) (*User, error) {
    args := m.Called(id)
    return args.Get(0).(*User), args.Error(1)
}
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Manual mocking: More code, less powerful assertions
- Dependency injection frameworks: Overhead for simple mocking
- Test doubles: Less flexible than full mocks

### 4. Coverage Measurement and Reporting

**Decision**: Go's built-in coverage tooling with automated thresholds

**Rationale**:
- Standard tooling integrates seamlessly with CI/CD
- HTML reports provide clear visualization of uncovered code
- Automated threshold enforcement prevents coverage regression
- Per-package reporting enables focused improvements

**Coverage Commands**:
```bash
# Generate coverage profile
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./src/...

# View HTML report
go tool cover -html=coverage.out

# Check coverage percentage
go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total:
```

**Threshold Strategy**:
- Target: 100% statement coverage for src/ packages
- Exclusions: *.pb.go files (generated code)
- Enforcement: CI/CD pipeline fails below threshold

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Third-party coverage tools: Standard tooling sufficient
- Branch coverage only: Statement coverage more comprehensive
- Manual coverage tracking: Error-prone and time-consuming

### 5. Achieving 100% Coverage

**Decision**: Systematic approach with coverage-driven development

**Strategy**:
1. Start with happy path tests (basic functionality)
2. Add error path tests (all error returns)
3. Add edge case tests (boundary conditions)
4. Add panic/recovery tests where applicable
5. Use coverage reports to identify gaps
6. Iterate until 100% is achieved

**Techniques for Hard-to-Test Code**:
- Use interfaces for dependency injection
- Mock time-dependent functions
- Test panic conditions with recover
- Use build tags for platform-specific code
- Test private functions through public interfaces

**Acceptable Exclusions**:
- Generated code (*.pb.go, *_gen.go)
- Main functions with only setup code
- Unreachable code (after panic)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Partial coverage goals: Doesn't meet requirement
- Integration-only testing: Misses unit-level issues

## Key Findings

### Technology Stack Decisions
- **Testing Framework**: Standard Go testing package
- **Assertion Library**: testify/assert for readable assertions
- **Mocking Library**: testify/mock for dependency mocking
- **Coverage Tool**: Built-in go test -cover

### Performance Optimizations
- Use t.Parallel() for independent tests
- Avoid expensive setup in individual tests
- Cache mock objects across test cases
- Optimize test data structures

### Test Data Management
- Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- Create test fixtures for complex data
- Implement test data builders for flexibility
- Isolate test data from production data

### CI/CD Integration
- Automated coverage reporting
- Threshold enforcement
- Fast feedback on coverage changes
- Integration with existing build pipeline

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
1. Remove existing test files from src/
2. Create tests/unit/ directory structure
3. Set up mock registry and helpers
4. Configure coverage tooling

### Phase 2: Core Package Testing
1. Start with models/ package (foundational)
2. Add services/ package tests
3. Test repositories/ and adapters/
4. Cover remaining packages systematically

### Phase 3: Coverage Optimization
1. Identify coverage gaps
2. Add missing test cases
3. Optimize test performance
4. Validate 100% coverage achievement

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance
1. Review test maintainability
2. Ensure consistent patterns
3. Validate deterministic execution
4. Confirm no external dependencies

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Test Suite Performance
- **Mitigation**: Use t.Parallel(), optimize fixtures, monitor execution time

### Risk: Mock Complexity
- **Mitigation**: Centralized mock registry, standard patterns, clear documentation

### Risk: Coverage Blind Spots
- **Mitigation**: Systematic coverage review, automated threshold enforcement

### Risk: Test Maintenance Burden
- **Mitigation**: Consistent patterns, clear naming, comprehensive documentation

## Success Metrics

1. **Coverage Achievement**: 100% statement coverage for src/ packages
2. **Performance**: Test suite execution < 60 seconds
3. **Independence**: Zero external dependencies during test execution
4. **Maintainability**: Consistent patterns across all test files
5. **Reliability**: Deterministic test results across environments
