## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a development team, we need to completely reconstruct our test suite from scratch to achieve comprehensive coverage and maintainability. The existing tests have evolved organically with inconsistent patterns, incomplete coverage, and dependencies on external systems. By removing all existing tests and systematically recreating them, we will establish a clean, consistent, and fully independent test suite.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a codebase with existing test files, **When** the reconstruction begins, **Then** all existing test files are removed completely
2. **Given** a clean slate with no tests, **When** tests are recreated, **Then** they follow consistent patterns and conventions
3. **Given** newly created tests, **When** coverage is measured, **Then** 100% statement coverage is achieved
4. **Given** test execution, **When** tests run, **Then** no external dependencies are required
5. **Given** a complete test suite, **When** tests are executed, **Then** they complete within 60 seconds total

### Edge Cases
- What happens when removing tests reveals untested critical code? → Tests must be created to cover all critical paths
- How does system handle code that is genuinely unreachable? → Code must be refactored to remove unreachable paths
- What constitutes an acceptable exclusion from 100% coverage? → Only *.pb.go files are excluded
- How are generated code files handled in coverage metrics? → Excluded from coverage calculation

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST remove all existing test files (*_test.go) from src/ packages
- **FR-002**: System MUST create new test files following table-driven test patterns where applicable
- **FR-003**: System MUST achieve 100% statement coverage for all src/ packages
- **FR-004**: Tests MUST execute without requiring database connections
- **FR-005**: Tests MUST execute without requiring network access
- **FR-006**: Tests MUST execute without requiring external services
- **FR-007**: System MUST create mock implementations for all external dependencies
- **FR-008**: Tests MUST be deterministic and produce consistent results
- **FR-009**: Tests MUST be independent and runnable in any order
- **FR-010**: System MUST generate coverage reports showing per-package and overall metrics
- **FR-011**: Test suite MUST complete execution within 60 seconds
- **FR-012**: Tests MUST be maintainable with clear naming and documentation

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Test execution performance must not degrade developer productivity (total suite < 60 seconds)
- **NFR-002**: Test code must be as maintainable as production code
- **NFR-003**: Coverage metrics must be automatically verifiable
- **NFR-004**: Test patterns must be consistent across all packages
- **NFR-005**: Mock objects must be reusable across test suites

### Key Entities
- **Test Suite**: Collection of test files for a specific package, must achieve 100% coverage for that package
- **Mock Object**: Simulated implementation of external dependency, must be configurable for different test scenarios
- **Coverage Report**: Metrics showing line, statement, and branch coverage per package and aggregate
- **Test Fixture**: Reusable test data and setup code, must be isolated from external systems

## Review & Acceptance Checklist

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

### ~~Clarifications Needed~~ (Resolved)
1. ~~**Test Execution Time**: What is the acceptable time limit - per package or for the entire suite?~~ → 60 seconds total
2. ~~**Package Scope**: Should 100% coverage apply to all packages in the repository or only specific directories (e.g., src/)?~~ → src/ packages only

---

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-23
- Q: Test Execution Time Limit? → A: 60 seconds for the entire test suite
- Q: Package Scope for 100% coverage? → A: src/ packages only (business logic focus)
- Q: How to handle genuinely unreachable code? → A: Refactor code to make it testable
- Q: Max time for single package tests? → A: No specific limit (total 60s constraint)
- Q: Which files excluded from coverage? → A: Only *.pb.go files

## Execution Status

- [x] User description parsed
- [x] Key concepts extracted
- [x] Ambiguities marked
- [x] User scenarios defined
- [x] Requirements generated
- [x] Entities identified
- [x] Review checklist passed (with clarifications)

## Success Criteria

1. **Complete Removal**: All existing test files have been deleted from the codebase
2. **Systematic Recreation**: New tests created following consistent patterns and conventions
3. **Full Coverage**: 100% statement coverage achieved across target packages
4. **Independence**: Tests run without any external dependencies (DB, network, services)
5. **Performance**: Test suite executes within defined time limits
6. **Maintainability**: Tests are clear, well-organized, and easy to modify
7. **Verification**: Coverage reports generated and validated automatically

## Assumptions

1. The codebase will be refactored where needed to achieve 100% coverage (removing unreachable code)
2. Development team has agreed to the complete removal approach vs incremental improvement
3. Generated code files (*.pb.go) are excluded from coverage requirements
4. Mock implementations will be created for all external dependencies
5. Table-driven test patterns are preferred but not mandatory for all tests

## Constraints

1. No external dependencies allowed during test execution
2. Tests must be deterministic - same input always produces same output
3. Test execution must not require special environment setup
4. Coverage measurement must use standard tooling (no custom metrics)
5. All tests must be runnable in CI/CD environment
