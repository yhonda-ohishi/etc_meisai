# Feature Specification: Specify Command Execution

**Feature Branch**: `001-specify-is-running`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "specify is running‚Ä¶"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: The feature description "specify is running‚Ä¶" is incomplete and doesn't provide enough context to determine what the specify command should do, what it operates on, or what the expected outcome is]

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: initial state unknown], **When** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specify command is executed but action unclear], **Then** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: expected outcome not specified]
2. **Given** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: system state not defined], **When** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: user interaction not specified], **Then** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: success criteria unknown]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: no edge cases can be identified without understanding the feature]?
- How does system handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: error scenarios cannot be determined]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What should the specify command do - generate specifications, validate them, or something else?]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What inputs does specify command accept?]
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the primary user interaction with specify?]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What data should be persisted, if any?]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What validation or processing should occur?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Unable to identify entities without understanding what "specify" operates on - specifications, configurations, or other data types]

**NOTE**: The feature description "specify is running‚Ä¶" is too vague to create a complete specification. Multiple clarifications are needed to understand:
1. What does "specify" refer to - a command, tool, or process?
2. What is it supposed to be running or operating on?
3. What is the expected outcome or value to users?
4. Who are the target users of this feature?
5. What problem does this solve?

Please provide a more detailed feature description to generate a complete specification.
