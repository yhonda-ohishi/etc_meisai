# Implementation Plan: 100% Test Coverage Implementation

**Branch**: `007-implement-100-test` | **Date**: 2025-09-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/007-implement-100-test/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Primary requirement: Achieve strict 100.0% test coverage across all source packages (src/services, src/repositories, src/adapters, src/models) with zero uncovered lines. Technical approach: Mock gRPC clients (pb.*RepositoryClient) instead of repositories to execute actual repository layer code while isolating external db_service dependencies. Performance constraint: <2 minutes execution time with hard failure on coverage <100%.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Go 1.21+ (existing codebase)
**Primary Dependencies**: testify/mock, gRPC, Protocol Buffers, Go test coverage tools
**Storage**: N/A (test coverage measurement, not data storage)
**Testing**: Go test with coverage analysis, testify/mock for gRPC client mocking
**Target Platform**: Development environment (test execution)
**Project Type**: single (existing Go module structure)
**Performance Goals**: Test execution <2 minutes for CI/CD integration
**Constraints**: Strict 100.0% coverage requirement, hard fail on any uncovered lines
**Scale/Scope**: All source packages in src/ directory (services, repositories, adapters, models)

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

✅ **I. Test File Separation**: All new test files will be placed in `tests/` directory structure (tests/coverage/, tests/mocks/, tests/helpers/)
✅ **II. Test-First Development**: Existing feature - improving test coverage, mock infrastructure will be created before coverage tests
✅ **III. Coverage Requirements**: Core focus of this feature - achieving 100% coverage target with hard failure on <100%
✅ **IV. Clean Architecture**: No changes to existing architecture, only enhancing test coverage
✅ **V. Observable Systems**: Test execution performance monitored (<2 minute constraint)
✅ **VI. Dependency Injection**: Leveraging existing DI pattern to mock gRPC clients while executing repository implementations
✅ **VII. Simplicity First**: Using existing gRPC client interfaces and testify/mock - minimal complexity addition
✅ **VIII. Code Quality Validation**: All test code will pass `go vet` validation

**Constitutional Compliance**: PASS - No violations identified

**Post-Design Re-evaluation**:
✅ **I. Test File Separation**: All contracts and test designs maintain tests/ directory structure
✅ **II. Test-First Development**: Mock infrastructure and test contracts created before implementation
✅ **III. Coverage Requirements**: Design specifically targets 100% coverage with strict validation
✅ **IV. Clean Architecture**: No modifications to existing layer separation
✅ **V. Observable Systems**: Performance monitoring built into test execution design
✅ **VI. Dependency Injection**: Design leverages existing DI pattern for effective mocking
✅ **VII. Simplicity First**: Minimal complexity - uses existing interfaces and standard tools
✅ **VIII. Code Quality Validation**: All test code will be validated with go vet

**Final Constitutional Compliance**: PASS - Design maintains all constitutional principles

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - Existing Go module with established src/ and tests/ structure

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Based on contracts and data model: Mock infrastructure setup tasks
- From quickstart scenarios: Repository and service coverage test tasks
- From constitutional requirements: Test file organization and validation tasks
- Performance and validation tasks for 100% coverage requirement

**Implementation Sequence**:
1. Mock infrastructure setup (gRPC client mocks, test helpers)
2. Repository coverage tests (execute repository code with mocked gRPC clients)
3. Service coverage tests (execute service code with mocked repositories)
4. Adapter and model coverage tests (complete remaining components)
5. Coverage validation and performance testing
6. Documentation and optimization

**Parallelization Strategy**:
- Different package tests can run in parallel [P]
- Mock setup before any coverage tests (dependency)
- Independent repository tests can run concurrently
- Service tests depend on repository infrastructure

**Estimated Output**: 29 numbered, dependency-ordered tasks with parallel execution markers

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command) - research.md created
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command) - data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md updated
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command) - Already completed
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
