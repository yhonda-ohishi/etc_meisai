# Data Model: 100% Test Coverage Implementation

## Overview
This feature focuses on test infrastructure and coverage measurement rather than business data. The key entities are test-related constructs that enable comprehensive coverage analysis.

## Core Entities

### Test Coverage Report
**Purpose**: Represents coverage analysis results for validation and reporting
**Attributes**:
- `Package`: string - Source package name (e.g., "src/services", "src/repositories")
- `CoveragePercentage`: float64 - Coverage percentage (0.0 to 100.0)
- `TotalLines`: int - Total lines of code in package
- `CoveredLines`: int - Lines covered by tests
- `UncoveredLines`: []string - Specific uncovered line references
- `ExecutionTime`: time.Duration - Test execution time for performance monitoring

**Validation Rules**:
- CoveragePercentage must be between 0.0 and 100.0
- CoveredLines + UncoveredLines count must equal TotalLines
- ExecutionTime must be positive duration
- Package must match existing source package structure

**States**: Generated → Validated → Reported → Archived

### Mock gRPC Client
**Purpose**: Test double that replaces real gRPC clients for isolated testing
**Attributes**:
- `ClientType`: string - Type of gRPC client being mocked (e.g., "ETCMappingRepositoryClient")
- `MockedMethods`: []string - List of mocked method names
- `ResponseScenarios`: map[string]interface{} - Configured responses for different scenarios
- `ErrorScenarios`: map[string]error - Configured error responses
- `CallCount`: map[string]int - Number of times each method was called

**Validation Rules**:
- ClientType must match existing pb.*Client interface
- MockedMethods must exist in the corresponding interface
- ResponseScenarios must have valid protobuf message types
- ErrorScenarios must use valid gRPC status codes

**States**: Configured → Active → Validated → Reset

### Test Execution Context
**Purpose**: Runtime context for test execution and coverage collection
**Attributes**:
- `TestSuite`: string - Name of test suite being executed
- `ParallelWorkers`: int - Number of parallel test workers
- `CoverageMode`: string - Coverage analysis mode ("atomic", "count", "set")
- `TimeoutDuration`: time.Duration - Maximum allowed execution time
- `FailOnUncovered`: bool - Whether to fail on any uncovered lines
- `PackageFilter`: []string - Specific packages to include in coverage

**Validation Rules**:
- ParallelWorkers must be positive integer
- CoverageMode must be valid Go coverage mode
- TimeoutDuration must not exceed 2 minutes (constitutional requirement)
- PackageFilter must contain valid package paths

**States**: Initialized → Running → Completed → Failed

### Repository Implementation Wrapper
**Purpose**: Represents the actual repository code that executes during tests
**Attributes**:
- `RepositoryType`: string - Type of repository (e.g., "ETCMappingRepository")
- `MockedClient`: Mock gRPC Client - Injected mock dependency
- `MethodsUnderTest`: []string - Repository methods being tested
- `ExecutionPaths`: []string - Code paths executed during test
- `ErrorHandlingPaths`: []string - Error handling code paths covered

**Validation Rules**:
- RepositoryType must match existing repository interface
- MockedClient must be properly configured
- MethodsUnderTest must exist in repository interface
- ExecutionPaths must represent valid code locations

**States**: Mocked → Executing → Validated → Analyzed

## Entity Relationships

### Test Coverage Report ↔ Test Execution Context
- **Relationship**: One-to-Many (One context generates multiple package reports)
- **Constraints**: Each report must belong to exactly one execution context
- **Usage**: Context aggregates coverage results from all tested packages

### Mock gRPC Client ↔ Repository Implementation Wrapper
- **Relationship**: One-to-One (Each repository has one mock client dependency)
- **Constraints**: Mock client type must match repository's expected client interface
- **Usage**: Repository wrapper uses mock client to isolate external dependencies

### Test Execution Context ↔ Repository Implementation Wrapper
- **Relationship**: One-to-Many (One context tests multiple repositories)
- **Constraints**: All repositories must complete within context timeout
- **Usage**: Context coordinates parallel execution of multiple repository tests

## State Transitions

### Test Coverage Report Lifecycle
```
Generated → Validated → Reported → Archived
    ↑           ↑           ↑         ↑
    |           |           |         |
  Initial    Validate    Generate   Store
  analysis   coverage    output     results

### Mock gRPC Client Lifecycle

Configured → Active → Validated → Reset

### Test Execution Context Lifecycle
```

```

## Implementation Considerations

### Performance Requirements
- Test execution must complete within 2 minutes (constitutional requirement)
- Coverage analysis should add minimal overhead to test execution
- Mock setup should be optimized for parallel test execution

### Quality Requirements
- 100% coverage validation must be strict and reliable
- Mock responses must accurately represent real gRPC behavior
- Error scenarios must cover all critical failure paths

### Constitutional Compliance
- All test files must be placed in tests/ directory structure
- Test-first development approach for mock infrastructure
- Dependency injection pattern must be preserved for mockability

This data model supports the core requirement of achieving 100% test coverage through comprehensive gRPC client mocking while maintaining performance and quality standards.
