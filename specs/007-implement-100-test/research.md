# Research: gRPC Client Mocking for 100% Test Coverage

## Decision Summary
**Primary Strategy**: Interface-based mocking using gomock with testify/mock integration
**Coverage Tool**: Go built-in coverage analysis with strict 100% validation
**Performance**: Table-driven parallel tests targeting <2 minute execution

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. gRPC Client Mocking Strategy
**Decision**: Mock pb.*Client interfaces at the repository level rather than raw gRPC calls
**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing dependency injection pattern in the codebase
- Allows execution of repository implementation logic while isolating external dependencies
- Maintains clear separation between unit tests (mocked) and integration tests (real gRPC)
- Enables comprehensive error scenario testing with realistic gRPC status codes

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **In-memory gRPC servers (bufconn)**: More realistic but slower, better for integration tests
- **HTTP-level mocking**: Too low-level, would miss gRPC-specific error handling
- **Direct function mocking**: Would bypass repository logic that needs coverage

### 2. Coverage Analysis Approach
**Decision**: Go's built-in coverage tools with atomic mode and strict 100% validation
**Rationale**:
- Native Go tooling provides accurate line-by-line coverage analysis
- Atomic mode ensures thread-safe coverage measurement for parallel tests
- Integrates seamlessly with existing CI/CD pipelines
- Supports both function-level and line-level coverage metrics

**Implementation**:
```bash
go test -covermode=atomic -coverprofile=coverage.out ./src/...
go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep "total:"
```

### 3. Test Organization Pattern
**Decision**: Separate test files by functionality with comprehensive table-driven tests
**Rationale**:
- Table-driven tests provide excellent coverage of input variations and edge cases
- Separate files enable parallel execution and clear test organization
- Follows existing codebase patterns in tests/contract/ directory
- Enables selective test execution during development

**Structure**:
- `tests/coverage/repository_coverage_test.go` - Repository implementation coverage
- `tests/coverage/service_coverage_test.go` - Service layer coverage
- `tests/coverage/adapter_coverage_test.go` - Adapter function coverage
- `tests/mocks/grpc_client_mocks.go` - Centralized mock definitions

### 4. Error Scenario Coverage
**Decision**: Comprehensive error testing including all relevant gRPC status codes
**Rationale**:
- Error handling paths are critical for production resilience
- gRPC provides rich error semantics that need proper handling
- Network errors, timeouts, and context cancellation are common in distributed systems
- Complete error coverage prevents production issues

**Error Categories**:
- Network errors: Unavailable, DeadlineExceeded, Internal
- Authentication: Unauthenticated, PermissionDenied
- Validation: InvalidArgument with field-specific errors
- Resource limits: ResourceExhausted
- Context handling: Cancellation, timeout

### 5. Performance Optimization
**Decision**: Parallel test execution with optimized mock setup
**Rationale**:
- Sub-2-minute execution requirement demands efficient test design
- Parallel execution leverages multi-core systems effectively
- Pre-generated mocks reduce test setup overhead
- Focused coverage scope avoids unnecessary test execution

**Optimizations**:
- Use `t.Parallel()` for independent test functions
- Pre-generate mocks with `go:generate` directives
- Scope coverage to src/ packages only
- Reuse mock controllers within test suites

## Implementation Sequence

### Phase 1: Mock Infrastructure
1. Create comprehensive mocks for all pb.*Client interfaces
2. Establish test helper functions for common mock setup patterns
3. Implement error scenario mock responses

### Phase 2: Repository Coverage
1. Test all repository client methods with success scenarios
2. Add comprehensive error scenario coverage
3. Test context handling (cancellation, timeout)
4. Verify input validation and boundary conditions

### Phase 3: Service Coverage
1. Test service layer methods with mocked repositories
2. Cover business logic paths and validation
3. Test transaction handling and error propagation
4. Verify service-to-service interaction patterns

### Phase 4: Validation
1. Implement strict 100% coverage validation
2. Add performance monitoring for <2 minute constraint
3. Create coverage reporting and failure handling
4. Validate zero uncovered lines requirement

## Quality Assurance

### Coverage Validation
- Hard failure on any coverage below 100.0%
- Line-by-line coverage analysis to identify gaps
- Automated coverage reporting in CI/CD pipeline
- Performance monitoring to maintain <2 minute execution

### Constitutional Compliance
- All test files placed in tests/ directory structure
- Test-first development approach for new test infrastructure
- Dependency injection pattern preserved for mockability
- Code quality validation with go vet for all test code

### Success Metrics
- 100.0% line coverage across all src/ packages
- Test execution time under 2 minutes
- Zero uncovered lines in coverage reports
- Comprehensive error scenario coverage
- Parallel test execution capability

This research provides the technical foundation for implementing comprehensive test coverage while maintaining performance requirements and constitutional compliance.
