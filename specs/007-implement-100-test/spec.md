# Feature Specification: 100% Test Coverage Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `007-implement-100-test`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement 100% test coverage by mocking gRPC clients instead of repositories to execute actual repository layer code while mocking external db_service dependencies"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � COMPLETED: Strategy to achieve 100% coverage identified
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identified: gRPC client mocking, repository layer execution, external dependency isolation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � All aspects clear from technical context
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � User flow: Developer runs tests and achieves 100% coverage
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement is testable via coverage metrics
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   � Test mocks, coverage reports, gRPC clients
7. Run Review Checklist
   � No clarifications needed, implementation strategy clear
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT developers need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no specific mock frameworks)
- =e Written for development team and QA stakeholders

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: How should the system validate that "100%" coverage is actually achieved? → A: Strict 100.0% - Any uncovered line fails the requirement
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable test execution time for the enhanced test suite? → A: Under 2 minutes - Reasonable CI/CD integration time
- Q: How should mock gRPC clients handle different response scenarios? → A: Error scenarios - Include both success and error response mocking
- Q: When a test run fails to achieve 100% coverage, what should happen? → A: Hard fail - Test execution stops immediately with error exit code

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the etc_meisai codebase, I need to achieve 100% test coverage to ensure all application code is tested while maintaining fast test execution by properly isolating external dependencies.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the current test suite with 0.7% coverage, **When** I run the enhanced test suite, **Then** I should see strict 100.0% coverage across all source packages or receive immediate failure with error exit code
2. **Given** the new test approach, **When** I execute tests, **Then** both service layer and repository layer code should be executed and covered
3. **Given** external db_service dependencies, **When** tests run, **Then** external services should be mocked while internal code executes

### Edge Cases
- What happens when gRPC client connection fails during testing?
- How does the system handle mock setup failures?
- What occurs when coverage tools cannot measure certain code paths?
- How are error response scenarios from mocked gRPC clients handled to ensure error handling code paths are covered?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Test suite MUST achieve strict 100.0% code coverage across all source packages (src/services, src/repositories, src/adapters, src/models) with zero uncovered lines
- **FR-002**: Tests MUST execute actual repository implementation code while mocking external gRPC clients
- **FR-003**: Test execution MUST complete within 2 minutes to maintain reasonable CI/CD integration time while avoiding real external service dependencies
- **FR-004**: Coverage reports MUST accurately reflect executed code paths in both service and repository layers and MUST fail immediately with error exit code when coverage falls below 100.0%
- **FR-005**: Test suite MUST isolate external dependencies (db_service) through gRPC client mocking that includes both success and error response scenarios
- **FR-006**: Tests MUST validate that dependency injection pattern is preserved and functioning
- **FR-007**: Coverage measurement MUST distinguish between mocked external calls and executed internal logic

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Test Coverage Report**: Represents coverage metrics per package, showing percentage and uncovered lines
- **Mock gRPC Client**: Represents mocked external service dependencies that return controlled responses
- **Repository Implementation**: Code that executes during tests, calling mocked gRPC clients
- **Service Layer**: Business logic that calls repositories and should be fully covered
