# Tasks: Test Coverage 100% Reconstruction

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/main/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✅), research.md (✅), data-model.md (✅), quickstart.md (✅)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Found: gRPC Server Dependency Injection Refactoring spec
   → Extract: Go 1.21+, gRPC, Protocol Buffers, testify/mock
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Test Coverage Infrastructure models
   → research.md: Table-driven tests with dependency mocking decisions
   → quickstart.md: Package-by-package test generation approach
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Fix dependencies, clean failing tests
   → Tests: Fix existing failing tests, add missing coverage
   → Core: Mock infrastructure, interface refactoring
   → Integration: Coverage measurement, reporting
   → Polish: Performance validation, CI/CD setup
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different packages = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness
9. Return: SUCCESS (78 test files identified, coverage reconstruction ready)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different packages, no dependencies)

## Dependencies
- Phase 3.1 (Setup) before all other phases
- Phase 3.2 (Fix Failing Tests) MUST complete before Phase 3.3+
- Phase 3.3 (Mocks) before Phase 3.4-3.8 (Testing phases)
- Phase 3.4-3.8 (All testing phases) before Phase 3.9 (Measurement)
- Phase 3.9 (Coverage) before Phase 3.10 (Validation)

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T005-T012 together to fix failing tests:
Task: "Fix validation edge cases in src/models/validation_edge_cases_test.go"
Task: "Fix ETC card number boundary validation in src/models/etc_meisai_test.go"
Task: "Fix import session validation errors in src/models/import_session_test.go"
Task: "Fix CSV parser date format errors in src/parser/csv_parser_test.go"
Task: "Fix repository mock expectations in src/repositories/*_test.go"
Task: "Fix service layer dependency injection tests in src/services/*_test.go"
Task: "Fix gRPC server integration tests in src/grpc/*_test.go"
Task: "Fix adapter conversion tests in src/adapters/*_test.go"
```

## Critical Success Metrics
- ✅ All 78 existing test files pass without failures
- ✅ 100% statement coverage across all src/ packages
- ✅ Test suite execution time under 30 seconds
- ✅ Zero external dependencies in test suite
- ✅ All mocks properly configured and functional
- ✅ Coverage reports generated successfully

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different packages/files, no dependencies
- Fix failing tests (T005-T012) is HIGHEST PRIORITY
- Current status: 78 test files exist, many failing
- Target: 100% coverage with all tests passing
- Focus: Table-driven tests with comprehensive mocking
- Performance budget: <30s total execution time

## Task Generation Rules Applied
- Each failing package → fix task marked [P]
- Each coverage gap → testing task marked [P]
- Mock generation → sequential dependencies
- Coverage measurement → after all tests complete
- Different packages = parallel, same files = sequential
- Setup before tests, tests before validation

---

**Total Tasks**: 50 tasks across 10 phases
**Estimated Completion**: 2-3 weeks with focused effort on test coverage
**Success Criteria**:
- All failing tests fixed and passing
- 100% statement coverage across all packages
- Robust mock infrastructure for dependency injection
- Maintainable, fast-executing test suite
