# Quickstart: Test Coverage 100% Reconstruction

## Prerequisites
- Go 1.21+ installed
- Project cloned and dependencies installed
- No running services required (all mocked)

## Step 1: Clean Existing Tests
Remove all existing test files to start fresh:

```bash
# Remove existing test files
find . -name "*_test.go" -delete
rm -rf tests/

# Verify removal
find . -name "*_test.go" | wc -l  # Should output: 0
```

## Step 2: Install Test Dependencies
Install required testing libraries:

```bash
go get -u github.com/stretchr/testify
go get -u github.com/stretchr/testify/mock
go get -u github.com/stretchr/testify/assert
go mod tidy
```

## Step 3: Generate Mock Infrastructure
Create base mock implementations:

```bash
# Create mocks directory
mkdir -p mocks

# Generate mocks for key interfaces
# This will be automated by the test generation
```

## Step 4: Generate Tests Package by Package
Execute test generation for each package:

```bash
# Models package (foundation)
go test -v ./src/models -cover

# Repositories package
go test -v ./src/repositories -cover

# Services package
go test -v ./src/services -cover

# Handlers package
go test -v ./src/handlers -cover

# gRPC package
go test -v ./src/grpc -cover
```

## Step 5: Verify Coverage
Check coverage for all packages:

```bash
# Generate coverage report
go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out

# View coverage summary
go tool cover -func=coverage.out

# Generate HTML report
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html
open coverage.html  # or start coverage.html on Windows
```

## Step 6: Run Full Test Suite
Execute complete test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
go test ./... -v -cover -race

# Run with parallel execution
go test ./... -v -cover -parallel 4

# Run with timeout
go test ./... -v -cover -timeout 30s
```

## Expected Results

After completing all steps:

1. **Coverage**: 100% statement coverage for all packages
2. **Test Count**: ~200-300 tests across all packages
3. **Execution Time**: < 30 seconds for full suite
4. **Memory**: < 100MB peak memory usage

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] All packages have 100% coverage
- [ ] No test failures
- [ ] No race conditions detected
- [ ] All mocks properly configured
- [ ] Tests run without external dependencies
- [ ] Coverage report generated successfully
- [ ] Tests complete in under 30 seconds

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Full test with coverage
make test-coverage

# Quick test (no coverage)
make test

# Generate mocks
make mocks

# Clean and rebuild tests
make clean-tests && make generate-tests

# CI/CD simulation
make ci-test
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tests fail with "mock not found"
**Solution**: Regenerate mocks
```bash
go generate ./...
```

### Issue: Coverage below 100%
**Solution**: Check uncovered lines
```bash
go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep -v 100.0
```

### Issue: Tests timeout
**Solution**: Check for infinite loops or blocking operations
```bash
go test -v -timeout 10s ./...
```

### Issue: Race condition detected
**Solution**: Add proper synchronization
```bash
go test -race -v ./...
```

## Package-Specific Notes

### models
- All validation methods must be tested
- GORM hooks need mock database

### services
- Mock all repository dependencies
- Test business logic edge cases

### handlers
- Use httptest for HTTP testing
- Test all response codes

### grpc
- Mock service layer
- Test proto conversions

### repositories
- Use in-memory implementation
- Test query construction

## Continuous Integration

Add to `.github/workflows/test.yml`:

```yaml
name: Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v4
        with:
          go-version: '1.21'
      - name: Test with Coverage
        run: |
          go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out
          go tool cover -func=coverage.out
      - name: Check Coverage
        run: |
          coverage=$(go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/%//')
          if (( $(echo "$coverage < 100" | bc -l) )); then
            echo "Coverage is below 100%: $coverage%"
            exit 1
          fi
```

## Success Criteria

The test reconstruction is complete when:

1. ✅ All existing tests removed
2. ✅ New tests achieve 100% coverage
3. ✅ All tests pass consistently
4. ✅ No external dependencies required
5. ✅ Tests complete in < 30 seconds
6. ✅ CI/CD pipeline configured
7. ✅ Coverage reports generated

## Next Steps

After achieving 100% coverage:

1. Set up coverage tracking
2. Add mutation testing
3. Implement property-based testing
4. Add performance benchmarks
5. Configure code quality gates
