# Feature Specification: Test Coverage 100% Reconstruction

## Feature Name
Test Coverage Complete Reconstruction

## User Stories
As a developer, I want to reconstruct the test suite to achieve 100% code coverage so that the codebase is fully tested and reliable.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Remove all existing test files
2. Recreate tests systematically for each package
3. Achieve 100% statement coverage across all packages
4. Ensure all tests pass without external dependencies
5. Tests must be maintainable and well-organized

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. Tests should run quickly (under 30 seconds total)
2. No external dependencies (no database connections needed)
3. Use table-driven tests where appropriate
4. Mock external dependencies properly
5. Tests should be deterministic and repeatable

## Technical Context
Current state:
- src/models: 35.3% coverage
- src/migrations: 4.5% coverage
- Other packages: 0% coverage

Target:
- All packages: 100% coverage

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All existing tests removed
- [ ] New test suite created with 100% coverage
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Coverage report shows 100% for all packages
- [ ] Tests run without CGO or database dependencies

## Dependencies
- Go testing package
- Mock/stub implementations for external dependencies
- Coverage tooling (go test -cover)

## Constraints
- No SQLite dependency
- No CGO required
- Tests must be idempotent
- Coverage must be measurable and verifiable
