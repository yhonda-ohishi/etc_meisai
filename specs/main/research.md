# Research: Test Coverage 100% Reconstruction

**Generated**: 2025-09-21
**Context**: Complete test suite reconstruction for ETC明細 Go service

## Research Questions Resolved

### 1. Go Testing Best Practices for 100% Coverage

**Decision**: Comprehensive table-driven test approach with dependency mocking
**Rationale**:
- Table-driven tests provide systematic scenario coverage
- Dependency mocking enables isolated unit testing
- Proven pattern for Go codebases achieving high coverage

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Individual test functions: Too verbose, harder to maintain
- Property-based testing: Overkill for business logic testing
- Integration-only tests: Brittle, slow, external dependencies

### 2. Mock Framework Selection

**Decision**: testify/mock with interface-based mocking
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard in Go ecosystem
- Excellent assertion capabilities
- Integrates seamlessly with go test
- Support for both manual and generated mocks

**Alternatives Considered**:
- GoMock: More complex setup, code generation overhead
- Hand-written mocks: High maintenance, error-prone
- Minimal mocks: Insufficient for complex behavior simulation

### 3. Test Organization Strategy

**Decision**: Package-level test files with parallel execution capability
**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Enables parallel test execution
- Follows Go testing conventions
- Easy coverage measurement per package

**Test Structure**:
```
src/package/
├── file.go
├── file_test.go
└── testdata/
```

### 4. Coverage Measurement Approach

**Decision**: Multi-level coverage analysis with gap identification
**Rationale**:
- Package-level coverage for granular analysis
- Overall coverage for project health
- Gap identification for targeted improvements
- CI/CD integration for enforcement

**Coverage Targets**:
- Statement coverage: 100%
- Branch coverage: 95%+ (where applicable)
- Function coverage: 100%

### 5. Dependency Isolation Strategy

**Decision**: Mock external dependencies at service boundaries
**Rationale**:
- Database operations: Mock at repository interface
- HTTP clients: Mock at client interface
- File system: Mock at file service interface
- Time operations: Mock time provider

**Boundary Points**:
- Database → Repository interface mocks
- External APIs → Client interface mocks
- File operations → File service mocks
- System calls → System interface mocks

## Technical Decisions Summary

| Aspect | Decision | Key Benefit |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Test Framework | testify/mock + assert | Industry standard, comprehensive |
| Test Organization | Table-driven per package | Systematic coverage, maintainable |
| Mocking Strategy | Interface-based mocks | Clean isolation, testable |
| Coverage Target | 100% statement coverage | Complete code verification |
| Performance Budget | <30s total execution | Fast feedback loops |
| Data Management | Factory pattern fixtures | Reusable, consistent test data |
| CI/CD Integration | Automated coverage reporting | Continuous quality assurance |

## Success Metrics

- ✅ 100% statement coverage across all packages
- ✅ Test suite execution under 30 seconds
- ✅ Zero external dependencies in tests
- ✅ All tests pass consistently
- ✅ Clear coverage gap identification process
- ✅ Automated coverage reporting in CI/CD
