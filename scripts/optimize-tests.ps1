## Baseline Performance
- Execution time: $($baseline.TotalSeconds) seconds
- Parallel execution: Default

## Optimized Performance
- Execution time: $($optimized.TotalSeconds) seconds
- Parallel execution: Enabled with t.Parallel()
- Improvement: $improvement%

## Optimizations Applied
- Added t.Parallel() to independent test functions
- Enabled parallel execution for test cases within functions
- Isolated environment-dependent tests
- Optimized mock setup and teardown

## Recommendations
1. Continue adding t.Parallel() to new tests
2. Use -parallel flag for CI/CD pipelines
3. Monitor test stability with parallel execution
4. Consider test sharding for very large test suites
