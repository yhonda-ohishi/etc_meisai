## Configuration & Setup

### Makefile Targets
```bash
make test              # Run all tests
make test-coverage     # Generate coverage report
make test-fast         # Optimized test execution (<30s)
make test-parallel     # Parallel test execution
make coverage-gate     # Enforce 95% minimum coverage
make coverage-detailed # Detailed coverage analysis
```

### CI/CD Integration
- GitHub Actions workflow (`workflows/coverage.yml`)
- Pre-commit hooks for coverage enforcement
- Coverage trend tracking
- Automatic coverage reporting

## Performance Metrics

### Test Execution
- **Total Test Suite**: < 30 seconds
- **Unit Tests**: < 1ms per test
- **Integration Tests**: < 100ms per test
- **Contract Tests**: < 50ms per test

### Coverage Metrics
- **Statement Coverage**: Target 100%
- **Branch Coverage**: Target 90%
- **Coverage Gate**: 95% minimum enforced

## Quality Assurance

### Mutation Testing Results
- Mutation kill rate: > 95%
