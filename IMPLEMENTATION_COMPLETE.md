## 🚀 How to Use

### Run Tests
```bash
# All unit tests
go test ./tests/unit/...

# With coverage
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out -coverpkg=./src/... ./tests/unit/...

# Contract validation
go test ./tests/contract/...
```

### Generate Reports
```bash
# HTML coverage report
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html

# Coverage summary
go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total:
```
